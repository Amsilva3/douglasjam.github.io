Today I had a great day, managed to accomplish everything I had planned. I didn’t go to the kindergarten and stayed with me, and that was no problem. I managed to entertain him with toys and games (no screens), he was nice and didn’t distract me too much from work.

At work, everything went fine, managed to accomplish my duties, at night helped at home, played with the kids, and at the end did one bicycle workout.

Lately, my workout training is increasing the training intensity, I started to sweat whenever I’m on tempo/Z3 training, and just feels great to see my body reacting to the exercise, during the endurance/Z2 training I had not so much fun, even though I know I have to do them to improve my cardiovascular system.

Today I tried to push harder to see my limits, but I felt capped by the equipment, even at the maximum gear of my stationary bicycle I didn’t manage to increase my heart rate up to the threshold, I’ve put the cadence above 150rpm, I was flying. I must study more about it, master the technique and try to avoid an equipment upgrade.

To end this day I manage to accomplish quite a lot in my app, the registration page is reworked and finished.
