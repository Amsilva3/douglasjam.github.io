Previous post I stated where I envision myself in the future, in this I'd like to make some kind of retrospective, sharing a few people and moments I'm grateful for. You already know I won’t be able to mention everyone and all the moments, but it will be a start.

I can’t record lacking food, a roof, education, or being forced to work as a child, all this was due to my parents and grandparents that worked hard. We didn’t come from wealthy families, but they worked hard to give their children the best they could.

As a father, I know how many plans you give up in order to focus on your children. My mother did this to us, she spent so much time looking after us, making sure we were on the right path. The same happened to my wife, after we got our children, she had to stop her career and change the focus.

I was graced in some ways during my life that some of my friends and relatives weren’t. From what I remember got a videogame as a child, did an informatics course when I was 10. Got a computer when I was 14. This may not seem impressive for most people, but for my reality, at the time this changed my life. My focus was driven to these things and the path I chose related to this.

I practiced martial arts for about 5 years when I was a teenager, being in such an environment helped me to learn many life lessons. During these times I learned about self-control, discipline, and resilience. I also made great friends that helped me to build the person I’m today.

And the last one I’d like to mention for today is the church community I joined when I moved to Hamburg. There I was surrounded by people full of faith, with a desire to serve others. There I not just learned about God but also about the human side of things, it brought me back to real relationships as I was too much immersed in technology before.
