Today I wanted to put out how do I visualize myself in the future. I won't take long as the purpose is to write this in 10min:

### Family & Friends
My family is stable, we have good communication, I and my wife are confidants, our children are happy with their parents as we are proud of them. Our family has quality time together and enjoys being with each other. My children trust me and rely on me to help them with their problems and challenges. I invest a good amount of my time with them. We're close to the people we like and our circle of friends is constructive and supportive. I have friends that enjoy doing sports together, be relaxing out of town with children, being an accountant person for my growth, and a counselor.

### Spirituality
I'll be bold and transparent about my faith. I'll share the gospel openly with friends, family, and to many congregations. My knowledge about the word of God will be sharp and deep. I'll be living a life seeking good and his commandments and be known by this.

### Finances
Money is not a problem anymore, enough money to guarantee a good living condition for me and my children will already be saved. My income also will come from diverse sources like dividends, real estate, bonds, own companies payouts, and speeches.

### Career/Business
I won't be an employee anymore. I'll be leading multiple companies. I'll be known as a leader that inspires others and help them to grow. My businesses will not only be about software, but I'll be exploring other fields like renewable energies, e-commerce, and catering.

### Contribution/Giving
Be a contributor to my neighborhood and place of birth, not just by own donations but also involve the people to contribute as well. There will be an App like the ShareTheMeals App where people will be able to support causes like "Help Poor Families in the City", "Support the Construction of a Public Playground". I also will support a tech school for people in need and be a loyal contributor to the church and its missions.

### Health/Fitness
I'll be doing sports weekly as a multi-sports guy, being able to rotate and experience all of my interests like running, cycling, martial arts, kayaking, and fishing. By there I'll have completed a Duathlon. Nutrition-wise my goal is to reduce my meat intake and to have planned weekly meals.
