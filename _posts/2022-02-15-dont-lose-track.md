How many times you had a task in mind, went to sleep and forgot about it? I had many, in the past I tried Trello, it had a huge backlog, columns for “Next”, “Soon” and “Doing”, but having an app, having to open it, update, move things sometimes doesn’t come to become a habit easily, especially if you are the only one working on the project. Because of this I decided to try a white board, not that it’s error prone, but as soon as I wake up, I look to the wall and see what’s written, I know what’s left to be done and what should come next.

I’ll be trying this idea over the next days; the goal is to write what I’m supposed to work on next on my personal projects and as soon as I finish I’ll erase the item from the board. I don’t want to make it a backlog, but only the next max 5 topics I’ll be working on.

Just to contextualize, for work we use Jira Scrum Dashboards. Works fine and it’s a great collaboration tool, but I’d like to go more old school this time.

But when I entered this dilemma trap, I ended up spending hours and hours comparing bicycles, checking how much would cost to bring the bicycle there, what people do to avoid assaulted, insurances in Brazil. By that I lost focus on my schedule, didn’t write some journals for 2 days, didn’t code on my app.

My next step as a fix will be to take it easy, sleep over it, think if it’s worth, if I do really need the upgrade. Maybe make it a reward to some goal accomplishment.
