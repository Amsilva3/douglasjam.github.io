I decided to do my bicycle workout outside today, it was could 3℃ with a feeling of -2℃ and very windy. The sun was shining, it was a beautiful day, but it was tough. My plan was to ride for 40km/2h but when I was at 45min I decided to come back. My feet started to freeze, I was wearing simple Nike Air shoes. Another point I should improve was my squeeze bottle of water, after so many minutes outside the water was very cold, making my body even colder, next time I’ll try to bring an insulated water bottle and my shoe's wind covers.

I managed to do my morning routine today as well, but it delayed my ride departure, making me arrive quite late ~10 am. Next time I may wake up earlier or do not do at all, but my plan is to stick it for a whole year at least without missing a day.

Over the day I didn’t work at all, played with the children, went outside to a playground with another family. After lunch we watched a Disney movie: “The Book of Life”, another Mexican Day of the Dead movie, it was a good one, but I wonder how many movies around the same topic will Disney make.

The rest of the way was just about cleaning the house, and helping the children with dinner, bath time, and putting them to sleep. That’s a simple report of my day, does not seem impressive but if you wonder, that’s a usual parent routine.

My plans for tomorrow are to stick with my morning routine, church, meet another family and try to spend some time on the app.
