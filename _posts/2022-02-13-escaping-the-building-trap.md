I’ve read this book 1.5 times, my goal with it was to understand the business side of a project, as a developer, we’re used to just ship features without caring about the surrounding ecosystem.  This book is a must-have for Product Managers and very helpful for developers that want to get more into the upper-level roles and get away from their niche.

What the book speaks is how to get away from the Sales-Led-Vision and go to the Product-Lead-Vision.

A Sales-Led-Vision is a company that builds features just to make sales, sales it’s important, but don’t build features just to fulfill a couple of users' requirements. Also don’t ship features just to tick a quarter review to prove you did something. By doing that you will end up having software with hundreds of features, where your users just use a couple of them, and perhaps one day move away from you because it became too complex.

A Product-Lead company builds software that meets the user's needs, solves their problems. Spend more time getting to know your user, their needs, and what frustrates them the most. Run experiments, iterate over a provided solution.

I did read this book quite a time ago and won’t be able to offer a proper review in this post, once I read it again which I will definitely do I’ll share once more.
