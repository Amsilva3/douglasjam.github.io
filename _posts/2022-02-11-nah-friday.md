After a powerful day, today my day didn’t start as planned, one of my children woke up early and interfered in my morning routine. Don’t blame her, it was already 7 am, but just becomes hard to accomplish all my tasks when someone needs your attention. But that should not be an excuse, I already started and will be making these routines during the day.

My plan for today is to spend more time with them and at night finish the next screen of my app, the e-mail confirmation one.

I’d like to share one nice story I learn while listening to the Will Smith audiobook, it was originally shared by Buddha:

There was once a man whose journey was to reach a distant mountain, but on his way, he found a big river. The place he was full of dangers and discomforts. He thought that he didn’t want to stay there as the other shore seemed safer and tranquil.
There were no boats or bridges around. With great effort, he built a raft using trees, branches, and twigs he gathered around. He succeeded in crossing the river by paddling with his hands. When arrived on the other side he thought: “The raft was so useful, I shouldn’t leave it here.”

Should he have done this and carried this raft across up the mountain albeit we wouldn’t need it anymore.

This story can have many interpretations. In our life, some things, places, items, people and situations are there just to help us to go from A to B. We should them let go as they might be a burden in our way forward. Don’t be the kind of person that gets in love by things, situations, and places. By that, you will only be stranded on one side of the shore.

There is all kind of people, some do not dare to build a raft because they think it wouldn’t work. Others build, but as they enjoy they spend their whole life building it and do not use it for what it was meant. Some build but enjoy being at the raft and the make it as their lives. Others will cross the river but carry the raft with them all the way, and there are the ones who leave it behind and follow their way. There is no right or wrong, just choose the right one for you knowing the pros and cons.
