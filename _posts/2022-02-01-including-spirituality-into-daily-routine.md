Waking up earlier today was easier than yesterday, I’ve done some changes in my mourning routine like reading the bible New Testament during my mourning route, I think everyone should also focus on their spirituality. To do not miss any point I started tracking all the habit points in an app until they become a real habit. 

Making affirmations and visualizations seemed a bit repeated today, I’ll have to find a way to improve it and make it feel good every day. 

I’ve also spent some time exercising today as planned, went out by bicycle with the family to do some groceries but as usual, it was too dark and windy here in the north of Germany.
I started listening to the Will Smith biography and didn’t manage to save so much time to work on my own projects.

Tomorrow I plan to catch up with my side projects and make a draft about my level 10 vision of my future self.
