Today I’m completing my 31st year of life, a year made of many challenges. Didn’t think it would be like this, expected way more of it. The second year of the Corona pandemic, working fully from home, and I barely met anyone over the year.

I was in Brazil up to march, up to this time it was great, but when I returned to Germany I had to quarantine 2 weeks after returning from Brazil, and once more we when contracted Covid, 1/12 months thrown away. Summer was great, things were open, but when winter came, the German government closed all again making things harder.

I had big plans for the year, one of them was launching our supermarket app, turned that at the end I got demotivated and slowed down up to the point to stop. But this year wasn’t a lost year at all. I’ve grown as a person, had to spend more time with my family, call my parents, and force myself to get in touch with others.

Some weeks before my birthday I’ve committed to big changes, started investing in my health and self-development. In this next year, I want to make the biggest leap of my life, becoming. Building new sources of income, being more athletic, and getting my German citizenship.
