How easy is to lose focus? I’ve been cycling for last weeks constantly, 3 times a week, 1, 1 and 2 hours consecutively. I already made some progress in my physics, but I feel my equipment is not up to the level where I want to be. My stationary bicycle have limited gears, making hard for me to increase my heart rate and my outdoor one is making me pedal in false, gears not shifting properly.

By that I decided to look out for new bicycles, but I have two dilemmas. My plan is to perhaps go back to Brazil, if I buy a bicycle here, I’d need to bring it back there. Here the purchase power is much higher, I could afford a bicycle much better easier here:

**Dilemma 1**: Bicycle price jumps are smooth that you end up to the expensive ones. I was looking for a bicycle around 1k EUR, found one looked nice, but if invested 200eur more I could get the next generation bicycle. With 100 EUR more and you get the next class Shimano shifters, and so on. The same applies everywhere in life, dam marketing people, they do it for smartphones and even cinema popcorn.

**Dilemma 2**: Brazil is a country with a big social inequality. I’m afraid of bringing an expensive bicycle there and driving it around the streets. Should because of this do not buy it here, survive with my old cheap one and buy one for the purchased power over there.

But when I entered this dilemma trap, I ended up spending hours and hours comparing bicycles, checking how much would cost to bring the bicycle there, what people do to avoid assaulted, insurances in Brazil. By that I lost focus on my schedule, didn’t write some journals for 2 days, didn’t code on my app.

My next step as a fix will be to take it easy, sleep over it, think if it’s worth, if I do really need the upgrade. Maybe make it a reward to some goal accomplishment.
