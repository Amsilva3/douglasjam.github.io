Today was the last day of my first week on this miracle morning change. I definitely can say that I was way more productive than before, after doing my ritual I'm ready to go full speed at work. Before I had to warm up and would only reach my potential at lunchtime.

I didn't feel tired at all and my schedule is quite full, here is one example of it during the weekdays that I exercise, on the opposite days instead of exercise I work on the app.

- 7 am wake up, start the morning routine
- 8 am prepare/bring children to the kindergarten
- 9:15 eat
- 9:30 start work
- 13:30 lunch break
- 14:00 back to work
- 17:30 stop work
- 18:00 family time / dinner
- 21:00 start indoor cycling + Audiobook
- 22:10 shower
- 22:30 idle time
- 23:00 journaling

I'm still experimenting with the morning routine items, currently, it consists of:

- Wake up
- Pray / Gratitude
- Brush Teeth
- Skin Care
- Affirmations
- Visualizations
- Drink Cup of Water
- Stretch
- Read Bible
- Make Bed
- Fill Water Bottle
