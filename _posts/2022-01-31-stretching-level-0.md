The first day doing the miracle morning didn't work as planned but was better than before. The plan was to wake up at about six but the bed was too comfortable and I stayed until 7 am. Did most of the planned items that includes drinking a cup of water, brushing teeth, skincare, affirmations, visualizations, and stretching.

I have to say that the day felt different after this productive warm-up, especially the affirmations part, I’ve never taken time before to say to myself what I can accomplish or where I wanted to be. The stretching part was the one that surprised me the most, after 10 years without stretching properly I can see that I came back to level 0, being able to stretch like a plier and ~160° like before.


Didn’t have much time during the day, spent most of the time fixing bugs due to a code cleanup made in a bloated library that leaked into other microservices. 

At night had the chance to finish the basic bootstrapping of a chat list windows of my app and spent the rest of the time upgrading the project to PHP 8.1. My goal for tomorrow is to finish some DTOs and create some dummy data to connect more of the UI screens to the backend.
