Today was the family day, was tempted to skip the morning routine but I managed to leave after 2 alarm snoozes. We had to hurry up as we wanted to go to the church at the city center, 1 hour seems to be enough to make breakfast, dress and help 2 children to do the same but it’s very tight, but as usual, after a bit of stress we left on time.

Was a rainy day in Hamburg, glad that I had decided to do my bike workout yesterday. The children adored their time at the church, they build some camel artwork and learned about Abraham. We were taught about finances, seems a bit weird at first glance but it’s a series about how to live fully, other services were about healthy, faith, relationships, etc.

It was spoken about something that I heard already before, but I was caught thinking about it. 80% of the world lives with less than 10 euros a day, 1% of the world has more money than the rest. If you had eaten twice today or had two pairs of shoes you can be considered rich. I’m not the most generous on earth, still have a lot to improve, but I caught myself thinking, billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and others are evil. They do contribute a lot to technology innovation, but couldn’t they contribute more, are the goals of colonizing Mars fair? They do give arguments like, giving food to everyone on earth won’t solve the problem, but should we let these people starve while we, including me, spend money on superfluous things like smartwatches, high tech cars, and dream trips?

After the service, we came home with another family and their children and had a nice meal, Bolognese Lasagna. The adults enjoyed a nice conversation, the children played among them with toys and a little of the Get Packed game.
