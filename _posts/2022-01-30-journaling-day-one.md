Today I plan start journaling, learned the importance of it in The Miracle Mourning audiobook which I'm about to finish. I aim to spend the maximum of 10 minutes writing this daily journals.

This book pushed me to try to put my life again under my control, stopping being mediocre about what I can accomplish in my life and taking care of myself by doing more exercises, taking care of my skin, habits, books and investments. 

My goal is that in a year from now I’ll be able to notice a considerable difference in my life, if I could project what I want to achieve it would be: 

-	Build a renowned website that will be the place where people could go to find out more about a certain city, sell/buy items, find services and perhaps delivery food. 
-	Read/listen at least 18 books over the year of 2022.
-	Be able to ride a bike sustainable for 2 hours on an average speed of 35km/h.
-	Run a half marathon.

And to end this journal, this weekend I did spend time with the children, download a Sponge Bob game on Stadia and played with them, we also received a family and spent some time with them. 

The children played among them and I spoke with my friend about real state investments in Brazil, how to solve a mold issue with plant I currently have and other topics. We didn’t go out, it was too windy, about 40km/h outside, I also spent 2h at the stationary bicycle doing some endurance exercise and learnt that I shouldn’t ride it with bare foot because the pedals are quite uncomfortable.
